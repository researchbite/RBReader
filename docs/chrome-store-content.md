## Privacy Practices Justifications

### Single Purpose Description
Jargon Translator serves a single, focused purpose: to help researchers and students understand complex academic and technical content by providing AI-powered text simplification, bionic reading enhancement, and intelligent highlighting. All features work together to create a comprehensive reading assistance tool specifically designed for academic and research contexts.

### Permission Justifications

#### activeTab Permission
**Justification:** The activeTab permission is essential for our extension to function. We need access to the currently active tab to:
- Extract readable content from academic papers and articles using Mozilla's Readability library
- Inject our reader overlay interface onto the current webpage
- Apply text transformations (jargon translation, bionic reading, highlighting) to the page content
- Track reading time for the current article
This permission ensures we only access the tab when the user explicitly activates our extension, maintaining privacy while providing core functionality.

#### Host Permission Use
**Justification:** Host permissions are required to:
- Access and parse content from academic websites, research repositories, and documentation sites
- Inject our content script and reader overlay on any webpage containing text the user wants to simplify
- Extract article content using the Readability library across different domains
- Apply our reading enhancements (translation, highlighting, bionic reading) to content regardless of the source website
We only access content when users explicitly activate the extension, and we don't collect or transmit webpage data to our servers.

#### Remote Code Use
**Justification:** Remote code execution is necessary for:
- Loading the Mozilla Readability library from CDN to extract clean article content from web pages
- Accessing OpenAI's API endpoints to provide AI-powered jargon translation and intelligent highlighting features
- Ensuring users always have access to the latest version of content parsing algorithms
All remote code serves the extension's core purpose of text simplification and reading enhancement. No user data is processed by remote code beyond the OpenAI API calls that users explicitly configure.

#### Scripting Permission
**Justification:** Scripting permissions are fundamental to our extension's operation:
- Injecting the reader overlay interface into web pages when users activate the extension
- Applying text transformations (jargon translation, bionic reading formatting, AI highlighting) to page content
- Managing the reading timer and statistics tracking
- Handling user interactions with our reading interface (toggles, settings, navigation)
- Preserving and restoring original text content when users switch between simplified and original versions
All scripting serves the direct purpose of providing reading assistance and text simplification features.

#### Storage Permission
**Justification:** Storage permissions are required to:
- Save user preferences (reading level, bionic reading settings, highlight preferences)
- Cache translated text to avoid re-processing the same content, improving performance and reducing API costs
- Store reading statistics and article history for productivity tracking
- Securely store the user's OpenAI API key in Chrome's sync storage
- Maintain extension settings across browser sessions and devices
All stored data directly supports the extension's text simplification and reading enhancement functionality. No personal browsing data is collected beyond what's necessary for the extension's operation.
